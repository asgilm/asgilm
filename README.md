## 🔐 About Me

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and its power to protect people, data, and digital environments. With a background in network systems and a growing portfolio of hands-on projects, I'm committed to becoming a highly competent and adaptable security professional. I’m especially interested in:

- Cloud security ☁️
- Threat analysis and forensics 🧪
- Ethical hacking & red teaming 🎯
- AI applied to cybersecurity 🤖

I'm currently completing the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) and documenting my journey through practical labs and personal projects.
